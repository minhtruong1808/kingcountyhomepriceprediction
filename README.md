King county house price prediction project (R)

Using a dataset recored from May 2014 and May 2015, I builded a regression model that predict a home price in King County area. It's essential to keep in mind that this dataset is very bias as the sample is constrainted within 1 year, there can be some questioning about how this model generalize to house lies beyond this time frame.
